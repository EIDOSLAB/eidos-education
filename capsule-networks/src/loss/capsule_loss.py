In the documentation I use the following notation to describe tensors shapes

b: batch size
B: number of input capsule types
C: number of output capsule types
ih: input height
iw: input width
oh: output height
ow: output width
is0: first dimension of input capsules
is1: second dimension of input capsules
os0: first dimension of output capsules
os1: second dimension of output capsules
